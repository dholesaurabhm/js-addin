===Planned Improvements for Javascript Parser Extension===

Please visit [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/js-addin discussion group] if you want to ask something or you have a great idea how to improve this addin.

I prefer to combine several significant features to one release. This strategy has following goals:
 # To be not annoying for users.
 # Minimize development and testing effort, because I am do this for free and do not have a lot of free time.
